# mlboot

The goal of *mlboot* is to provide a powerful, flexible, and
user-friendly way to estimate and compare the performance of machine
learning (and other predictive) models using bootstrap resampling. It
was created in collaboration by [Jeffrey Girard](https://jmgirard.com/)
and [Zhun Liu](http://justin1904.github.io/); this version for R is
maintained by Jeffrey Girard and a similar version for Python is
maintained by Zhun Liu.
